I am planning to use SLLM(Small LLM) + Web App + CDN JSdelivr + Mediawiki (Wikipedia API) for creating a web app for ChatBOT App Hackathon,
Which category should I choose?
What do you think?

3/3




Thought for 17 seconds
Based on your tech stack—a small LLM integrated into a web app that pulls live content via the Wikipedia API and uses a CDN for quick asset delivery—the most fitting category is one that highlights Conversational AI/Chatbot Innovation.

Why this category?

• Core Functionality: Your app is a chatbot at its core, designed to interact with users via a conversational interface.

• Smart Integration: Using a small LLM for dialogue management alongside the Mediawiki API to pull in dynamic content (Wikipedia data) demonstrates an innovative use of external data sources to enrich the conversation.

• Performance & Accessibility: Leveraging a CDN like jsDelivr ensures fast and reliable delivery of your web assets, which is a great bonus for user experience and overall performance.

If the hackathon offers sub-categories like “Best API Integration” or “Best Web App,” you might consider those as well—especially if you feel your implementation of the Mediawiki API is a standout feature. However, if you must pick one, the Conversational AI/Chatbot category is your best bet as it best encapsulates your project’s overall focus and innovation.

With this Tech Stack, Which is best ChatBOT that I can make to win in Hackathon?
Reasoned about winning ChatBOT ideas for 13 seconds
Based on your tech stack, one standout idea is to build a "WikiSmart Assistant" – a conversational research chatbot that uses your small LLM to understand and generate natural language while dynamically pulling detailed, up-to-date information from Wikipedia via the Mediawiki API.

Key Features:
Dynamic Knowledge Retrieval: The chatbot can answer user queries on diverse topics by fetching and summarizing content from Wikipedia. This means that users get accurate, well-sourced responses, ideal for educational or research-oriented queries.
Conversational Flow: Your SLLM drives natural and engaging dialogues, enabling follow-up questions and clarifications that make the conversation feel truly interactive.
Fast and Responsive UI: Leveraging jsDelivr as your CDN ensures that assets (like images, CSS, and JavaScript files) load quickly, contributing to a seamless user experience.
Rich Media Integration: You could enhance responses with relevant images or diagrams directly from Wikipedia, adding visual appeal and context.
Why This ChatBOT Stands Out:
Innovative API Integration: By combining the strengths of a small LLM with live data from Wikipedia, you create a tool that not only chats but also educates. This kind of innovation in sourcing and presenting information can set your project apart in a hackathon.
User-Centric Design: The assistant can be designed for students, researchers, or curious minds, addressing a broad audience while showcasing the practical utility of AI in everyday learning.
Scalability and Speed: The use of a CDN ensures that your web app remains fast and accessible, even under heavy load—a crucial factor in hackathon demos and competitions.
This "WikiSmart Assistant" not only aligns with the strengths of your tech stack but also demonstrates a creative use of modern AI and API integration, which can significantly boost your chances of winning in a hackathon. What do you think?
